This is a forum for Queen's students me and my group mates made for our Fundamentals of Software Development class. Since this is a computer engineering course, we had to use ```C++```. I decided to make a backend web server that uses a ```C++``` websocket implementation from [Beast](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/beast/doc/html/index.html), a library from [Boost C++ libraries](https://www.boost.org/). The backend saves all information such as posts and user information in our ```SQLite``` database. For our frontend, we went with ```React``` for a quick and robust user interface. Check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/conboy/QueensCORE).

Here's our presentation showing off a demo of our project.
